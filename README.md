# TIL
my journey to be a dev from 220610  
it will be related to techstuff(dev,CS,crpyto, blockcain ?)  

# RULES FOR MYSELF
- one commit a day 
- daily log ONLY! which means I will keep it simple as possible as I can.
- every topic in daily log should contain ONLY 1~5 sentences.
- I will not be going to dive into detail. I have a blog for it later.
- I am a lazy artist. I never finished something. so I thought it would be better for me to just do it BREIFLY
