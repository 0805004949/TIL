## how-to-add-user-in-linux
- you have two optins to make a user in linux; You can create a user with the sudo permission.  
  a.  `useradd`
  b. `adduser`
- `useradd` :  This command is widely used in all linux distribution. Meanwhile neither it will make user group in home dir nor it will let you use bash shell in default,(in default, it sets in `/bin/sh`) it gives more flexibility. `-m(â€”create-home)` options is for making a user dir 
```
useradd -m [username]
```
- `adduser` : This command utilizes `useradd` in the backend. It comes as a softlink or a pearl script so it won't work with some linux distribution. This command supports user-interaction, setting password, making a user dir and sets `/bin/bash` sehll. Which means it allocates resource automatically. 
```
adduser [username]
```
- To check if you made a user, at the end, you will see your latest made user.
```
cat /etc/passwd 
```
 - If you want to see the password for the user
  ```
  passwd [username]
  ```

## diff-between-sudo-and-su
- `root` account == administrator in window OS
- In the name of `root` user, you have maximum perssion and can do whatever you want to do in the system.
- When you create a user in linux, that new user won't have same permission as `root`  has. e.g) new user won't execute `apt-get get install` . So, you need to borrow a permission from `root`
- Thats how `su` and `sudo` came up. Both of them allow a user to execute a command with root permission.
- `sudo` : Meanwhile you dont need to change your identity, you can run a command with the permission of other user accounts 
`-i` for logging in shell, `-u` for a specified user.
```
sudo -i -u [username] [command]
```
- `su`  : When You need to switch to other account. `-` option for granting all env variable to current user. Whenever you change your identity, you need to type the password for expected username.(To run `sudo` you type your password). also you can type `exit` for log out.
```
su - 
```
by running a below command, you can be that user 
```
su - [username]
```
- `sudo` reminds you that neither you are a root nor another account. In human-computer-interaction perspective, I think this is great thing to decrease the human made mistakes

## delete-a-user-and-select-user-group-in-linux
- to see what group i am in
```
id [username]
grep -i [username] /etc/group
groups [username]
```
- to delete user: `-r` for remove home directory and mail spool, `-f` for forcing removal even its not owned by you
```
userdel -rf [username]
```
