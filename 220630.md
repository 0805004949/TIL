## how-to-add-user-in-linux
- choose js, if you want to be a frontend dev. no other choice exists!  
- frontend = css + HTML + js (this is totally insane and its the only reason why i want to use it so badly)
- backed = js + @ (machine learning, socket.io for live chatting)
- if you want to make something in 3D USE JS
- vscode, slack, figma was built under js
- in js, you can make desktop app(by electron), mobile app(by react native)

Back in 1995, Netscape was the most popular browser.   it was build based on HTML and CSS which means it was not interactive.   So, to make it more interactivly(for instance, if you click a button, sth might pops. but it didnt happen ATM) **Brendan Eich** made a programming language for the dynamic browser. Afterwards, WWW became a thing and because js already exsisted ppl kept building on js. js might not be the perfect language, but the web browsers are based on js! ppl just can't update or deprecate some parts of js since most of web page might go wrong. so, stick with js!



## how-to-run-js
- browser does not run js directly, indeed it reads HTML and HTML imports CSS and JS
- make HTML file then import scriptfile(javascript and css)
```
- index.html // import below files
- app.js
- body.css
```
- on your browser open dev tool then check out console! despite you havent downloaded js you can directly use js at the browser =) 

## how-to-declare-variables
- const : constant, if you arent going to change the value of it
- let : if you are going to change later on 
USE CONST and if you think that variable's value might change then change the variable into let
- DONT USE OLDSCHOOL `var`
- use camelCase in js(meanwhile python use snakecase at naming)

## data-type-in-js
- number
- string
- boolean
- array 
```
const tempArray = [null, 1, 2, true, false, undefiend]
tempArray.push("apple")
tempArray[0] = "hi" //change
```
- null : nothing. it is diff from false. false has value
- undefined : let something; but if you donâ€™t give any value. it exists in memory but it is just not defined yet.
- object : saying we are making a game character. then property represent a single entity that is like below code
```
const player = {
	name:"0805004949",
	age:13,
	sayHello: function(otherPerson) {
		console.log("hi, I am "+name+" nice to meet "+ otherPerson)
	}

};
console.log(player.name);
player.sayHello("james");
```

## why-const-js
- if you change the element of constant variable, thats fine but if you just change the whole object then js will give you an error
```
const player = {
	name:"0805004949",
	age:13,
	sayHello: function(otherPerson) {
		console.log("hi, I am "+name+" nice to meet "+ otherPerson)
	}

};
player.name = "jenny" // works
player = 123456 // error

const tempArray = [1,2,3,4]
tempArray.push([1]) //works
tempArray = "test" //error 
```


## conditions-js
- or ||
- and &&
- eq ===
- not wq !==

**== and === in js**  
in js, `===` is more strict comparison
```
console.log(2=="2"); // true
console.log(2==="2"); // false

if (condition) {
} else if (condition2) {
} else (condition3) {
};
```




## some-native-function-js
- prompt(str) : old-style functions it pauses the js. DONT USE IT
```
input_data = prompt ("how are you")?
```
- isNaN(obj) : check if its not a number, if obj is number then it will return false
- parseInt(obj) : return number if its stringfied-number otherwise it returns NaN
```
const age = parseInt(prompt("how old are you"))

if isNan(age) {
	console.log("not a number")
}
```
