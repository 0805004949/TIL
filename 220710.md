# 220710

# tl;dr
- docke run -v will create new dir while docker --mount type=bind won't 
- you can make github repo via github API
- 127.0.0.1(localhost) is loopback addr while 0.0.0.0 is invalid or unknown target addr for local machine

## diff-between-volume-and-mount-in-docker
- docker volume creates the dir that has not been existed on the docker host (creates dir)
```
docker run -v HOST_dir:CONTAINER_dir  python
```
- docker bind mounts generates error if a file or a dir that does not yet exist on the docker host.
- new user shuld use the `--mount` bc thats what dockerhub doc said LOL
```
docker run --mount type=bind, source=HOST_DIR \
                  target=CONTAINER_dir \
       python
```

## creating-github-repo-via-commandline
- supposing you already generated a token
```
curl -u 'USERID' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"REPO-NAME","description":"DESCRIPTION"}'
```

## diff-between-localhost-and-127.0.0.1-and-0.0.0.0
- 127.0.0.1 : s the loopback address (also known as localhost).
- 0.0.0.0 : In the context of servers, 0.0.0.0 means "all IPv4 addresses on the local machine". If a host has two ip addresses, 192.168.1.1 and 10.1.2.1, and a server running on the host listens on 0.0.0.0, it will be reachable at both of those IPs.
