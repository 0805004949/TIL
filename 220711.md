# tl;dr
- `-d '{"key":"name"}' -H "Content-Type:application/json"
- you code from framework and need to learn the specific way of using it while you can just use library IN your code
- 301 for redirection. it sends another req to changed server. 400 wrong data and 401 for auth

## how-to-use-curl-for-sending-POST-request
  ```
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install -y curl
  ```
- you specify the data type when sending POST requests
```
curl -d '{"key":name}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost/ping
```
## diff-between-framework-and-library
- Both of them implemented the common code that developeres uses a lot
- e.g: the web framework implemented the code that every web dev will use like networking things. you dont have to code for it but you need to focus on other business logic
- In framework, your code starts from the framework's baseline
- Meanwhilem the library, you can just borrow it and use it IN YOUR CODE

## status-code
- 405 wrong methods. you should change your method
- 400 wrong data type
- 301 redirection. endpoint of the target has been changed. once the client received 301 it will send another req to changed host
- 401  auth(did you login?)

## feature-of-HTTP
- req&res model
- stateless
